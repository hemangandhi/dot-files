mod = windows key

<mod-#> = move to workspace #
<shift-mod-#> = move current window to workspace #
<mod-shift-enter> = open terminal
<mod-j> = move to window "clockwise"

<mod-h> = move window "clockwise"

Only resizable tall:

    <mod-shift-k> = move divider down (resizing)
<mod-q> = reload config
<mod-enter> = reset layout
<shfit-mod-q> = quit
<mod-space> = change layouts (current window can be made full-screen)
<mod-.> = increment the number of vertical windows
<mod-,> = decrement the number of vertical windows
<mod-t> = open "scratchpad" (currently just a terminal)

<f1 - 3> = volume control
<f4> = close current window
<f5> = next layout algorithm (resizable tall, full, 3 col, spiral)
<f6> = disable touchpad
<f7> = flight mode
<f8> = close window to go to.
<f9> = blank screen

<f11-2> = brigthness (as desired)
<menu button (right of alt)> = rofi
<prtsc> = print screen

Notes on multi-head:
    -> The current workspace is yellow. Workspaces on other displays are in angle brackets (on xmobar)
    -> Focus is always indicated in yellow.
    -> Moving to a workspace on another display either moves that workspace to that display or swaps
       if the destination is being displayed elsewhere. (So that the current is display where the old was.)
<mod-w> = move focus to display 1
<mod-e> = move focus to display 2
<mod-r> = move focus to display 3
<mod-shift-w> = move window to display 1
<mod-shift-e> = move window to display 2
<mod-shift-r> = move window to display 3
