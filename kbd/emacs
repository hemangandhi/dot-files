M = alt

<M-(number)> can be entered before another key combination to pass an argument.

<C-x> <C-f> = find a file.
<f1>        = terminal
<C-h> k     = help on a key combination (enter the key combination after k).
<C-x> <C-s> = write.
<C-x> s     = for each buffer, ask and then write.
<C-x> o     = go to other window
<C-x> b     = switch buffers.
<C-x> r     = rename buffer.
<C-x> <C-b> = list buffers.
<C-x> <C-c> = exit. Prompts for saving.
<C-g>       = cancel command.
<C-x> 2     = duplicate current buffer below.
<C-x> 3     = duplicate current buffer to the right.
<C-x> 1     = close all but current window.
<C-x> 0     = close current window.
<M-x> is like ":":
      text-mode = for editing text
      kill-some-buffers = be prompted to kill buffers one by one
      untabify = make tabs spaces preserving columns

<C-w> [hjkl] = window movement
<C-x> 4 0    = kill window and buffer
<C-x> k      = kill buffer (will prompt for name)

<C-a><C-k>   = remove everything in minibuffer

Terminal mode: <C-x> is <C-c> and <M-x> is <C-c><M-x>

Evil mode: Everything in vim without the comma works.
-> vsp, sp work
-> :! works as do :w and :q
-> <C-w> is as expected.

Magit:
magit-<cmd> will usually work.
<C-c><C-c> to exit the commit file

Dired buffers:
R = rename (anything)
C = copy selected (can tag many)
D = delete
g = refresh
M = chmod
P = print
c (dired-do-compress-to) = compress the files (algo. by extension)
A = grep with regexp
Q = find and replace with regexp
m = mark file

Package list:
i = install package
d = delete
u = unmark
U = update all
x = execute
