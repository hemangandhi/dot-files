# He Up D00t

These are my dot files and they mostly suck.

But they make me happy.

The `kbd` folder has a few sparse notes.

The `commit-push.sh` script is solvenly and trash and mostly works for me.

The `colors` and `ftplugin` folders go under the `~/.vim` directory if you wanna.

## I use arch

... so somethings are seriously janky. I'll mention things in the `kbd` directory when I feel like it.
