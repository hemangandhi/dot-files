# He Up D00t

These are my dot files and they mostly suck.

But they make me happy.

The `kbd` folder has a few sparse notes. (That are slightly out of date.)

The `commit-push.sh` script is solvenly and trash and mostly works for me.

The `colors` and `ftplugin` folders go under the `~/.vim` directory if you wanna.

### Haha nix go brr. So the `nix-envs` dir has a useful README.

(Because I like to debug my package managment.)
